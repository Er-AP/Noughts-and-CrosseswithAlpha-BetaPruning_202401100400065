Noughts and Crosses, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a simple two-player
game where one player (usually "X") attempts to form a line of three
"X"s in a 3x3 grid, while the other player (usually "O") attempts to do
the same. The game can be played manually or computationally, and
the challenge often lies in finding the best possible moves
